# Monolith-Application

### Break a Monolith Application into Microservices with Amazon Elastic Container Service, Docker, and Amazon EC2


In this project, I will deploy a monolithic node.js application to a Docker container, then decouple the application into microservices without any downtime. The node.js application hosts a simple message board with threads and messages between users.


#### Why this Process Matters

The traditional monolithic architectures are hard to scale. When introducing new features, languages, frameworks, and technologies becomes very hard, limiting innovation and new ideas.

Whereas within a microservices architecture, each application component runs as its own service and communicates with other services via a well-defined API. This architecture can be written using different framewords and programming languages, and can deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.

Within a microservices architecture, each application component runs as its own service and communicates with other services via a well-defined API. Microservices are built around business capabilities, and each service performs a single function. Microservices can be written using different frameworks and programming languages, and you can deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.
